# As an artist

Minting an NFT, or a series of NFTs, can be considered as an art!

We're currently developing an interface (web app) for Āto v1.0, but you already can mint on Polygon using [the legacy version of our minter](https://ato-main.netlify.app/).

If you want to personalize even more and touch the code of your NFT, you can go ahead and use [Āto v1.0](https://github.com/ATO-nft/ato).

_[We need to add more content here. It's coming. Thanks for your patience! Feel free to contact us directly via [Element](https://matrix.to/#/@julienbrg:matrix.org), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/julienbrg), [Discord](https://discord.gg/xw9dCeQ94Y), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienberanger/) or [email](mailto:julien@ato.network).]_
